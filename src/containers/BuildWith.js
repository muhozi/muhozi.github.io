        <h1>I build with</h1>
        <p>
          I wrote the codes for the first time when I was in High school in 2013
          the primary coding practices were web related like using languages
          like PHP and Javascript accompanied with HTML and CSS. After high
          school, I started to work on real-world projects, particularly related
          to web development. I released the first used web application in May
          2015. For now, I primarily use Javascript, Python, and PHP.
        </p>
        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <p>
          For me, Javascript is Sexier than others, despite{' '}

            its fatigue
          </a>
          ! I have been using Javascript on numerous projects with different
          frameworks for both backend and front-end.

        <b>UI JS Frameworks I build with:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            React / React-native{' '}

          <li>JQuery</li>

        <b>NodeJS Frameworks I build with:</b>

        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>
          I started using Python in 2017, I started using for job qualification.
          Currently, I use python frequently: I build with <b>Django</b> and{' '}
          <b>Flask</b> Frameworks.
        </p>
        <h2>PHP</h2>
        <p>
          I have been using PHP(Hardcoded) since high school. After finishing
          high started using a framework which was <b>Laravel</b>. I started
          using Laravel in 2016 (It was Version 5.2). At the moment I don
          {"'"}t use it Laravel/PHP frequently except for quick and small
          projects(like Hackathons)
        </p>
        <h2>HTML/CSS</h2>I build using HTML,CSS, and SASS. I mostly use
        Bootstrap as a Framework
        <h2>Others</h2>
        Due to working in full-stack web development made me build with the
        followings:
        <li>REST APIs design</li>
        <li>Third-party API integrations</li>
        <li>Web Sockets(Socket.io)</li>
        <li>Firebase</li>
        <li>
          Linux web server configurations(Currently using Digital ocean
          droplets)
        </li>
        <li>SQL Databases(MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)</li>
        <li>NoSQL databases(MongoDB & RethinkDB)</li>
